This repository contains the codes for the article "Neural Integral Operators for Inverse problems in Spectroscopy", 	available on [arXiv](arXiv:2505.03677). 
The datasets have been shared with us (see acknowledgments in the paper), and they might be shared upon request, but we are currently unable to post them here.
